# [CAT-CH3](https://alicja-malinowska.github.io/Cat-ch3_game/) - A match-3 game full of kitties!


This is a match-3 style game written using HTML Canvas and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to match enough tiles to clear the pink background. The background under each tile is cleared when a tile is matched with at least 2 other tiles of the same kind. The tiles then disappear, background behind them gets cleared, tiles above them fall down and new tiles are added from the top to fill all rows and columns. The match attempt is made by clicking one tile and then another(adjacent) for them to swap places, if in result of that there is at least one match (a row of at least 3 tiles with the same symbol), the matching tiles are destroyed. Each destroyed tile is worth 10 points. There is a limited number of moves in which a player has to clear the board. The game is over when the board is clear (win), when a player runs out of moves or if there are no valid moves to make (it is impossible to make a match by swapping any tiles on the board) (lose).


#### External userâ€™s goal:

The users are people who want to play a simple and fun game, either on their mobile, tablet or desktop. The game is especially aimed for people who like cats, but other players should find it enjoyable as well. 

#### Site owner's goal:

The site owner's goal is to play an enjoyable game, share it with others and spread the love for cats!

 
## UX

The target audience for this application are mobile phone users. The game is simple so it is expected to be played on a mobile device when a user wants quick entertainment to which does not have to commit a lot of time. For example, to play on a bus, during lunch break etc. For this reason, the size of the game is designed to fit in a mobile device screen and take up the majority of it. However, the game can be played on any device. 

The cat theme is there to make the game more funny and it is mostly targeted at the people who like cats and/or are frequent users of websites with memes etc, which are full of funny cats. 

The name of the game was designed to be a word play, as the type of the game is match-3, but the theme is cats, which you should 'catch' on the board to win. 

This is a single page application with a simple design, so that the game window is the most important part of the website. The user can immediately start playing the game or they may choose to read the intructions first. The instructions are available at any stage of the game. It is also easy and straight-forward to restart the game or start a new one after finishing.

## Features

All the features were added to make the navigation simple and intuitive, and the experience - engaging and enjoyable. 

 
### Existing Features

#### Layout

* Layout - the layout is designed in the way that the game screen is always the most important and eye-catching element. On mobiles it takes the vast majority of the screen space. A button that opens modal with instructions is either at the bottom of the screen (for taller mobiles) or on the top right (for shorter mobiles) - this assures that the button is visible straight away for the user and there is no need to scroll down (which could mean that the user misses it altogether). On tablets that are not wider than 767px the screen is vertically centered and the button is available to click and show the instructions. On tablets of 768px or wider the game screen is in the top half on the screen and the instructions - in the bottom. This alignment is set for all the taller devices with the height of at least 1025px. On desktops (more generally, devices that are wide and not as tall) the instructions are on the left half of the screen and the game screen is on the right. 
* Instructions - they are available to the user during the whole time they visit the webpage. In the mobile view they can be viewed by clicking "How to play" button and on desktop they are visible to the user to the left of the game screen, regardless the state of the game.
* "How to play" button - this is available on the small and medium screens. Once the button is clicked a modal with instructions appear. This allows a user to read instructions on every stage. The instructions are easily available and they are unlikely to be missed. 
* Modal with the instructions - this allows a user to access the instructions whenever they want to and it does not require the user to leave the game or have to look for the instructions by scrolling down etc. The modal can be closed using the 'x' on the right top corner or the 'OK' button at the bottom. This lets the user close the modal as soon as it is opens, and at the same time does not require the user to go back up after reading all the instructions.

#### Game

* "Play" button - this button appears together with the starting screen and when clicked, it triggers a start of the game. When the game is started, the button changes to "New game" which resets the game without going back to the start screen. This button can be clicked at any time to discard the previous game and start a new one. When the game is finished, the button changes to 'PLAY AGAIN' and when clicked, brings the player to the starting screen. 
* Animation - whenerver there is a match (either initially when the game is first created, or later as a result of user's action), the matched icons disappear (after a short delay, so the user can see the actual match) and the icons above fall down. This animation was implemented to gove the user most natural experience and so that the user can easily understand what happens on the board (as opposed to e.g. 'magically' disappearing and appearing icons). The animation is also implemented when the icons are swapped.
* Cell highlight - when an icon (or the area around it) is clicked, the cell containing it is highlighted (a sqaure a bit smaller than the cell is drawn). This allows the user to see which icon they selected by clicking on it. When the selected icon is clicked again, the higlight disappears to inform the user than this is no longer selected. If one cell is highlighted and the user clicks another one which is not adjacent, the higlight is removed from the first one and added to the second one. This informs the user that two icons that are not adjacent cannot be selected. When the user clicks two adjacent icons, the animation is triggered and the highlight is removed from both of the cells to indicate that the action has been completed and the new selection needs to be made.
* Resloving - when the matches are made, they are removed from the board and the empty spaces are filled with the new icons. For this short time, the user is not able to swap the icon, which is indicated by the lack of highlights when clicking.
* Swapping - when the user click two adjacent icons, they are swapped. If there is a match created by this action, the matched icons disappear and the resolving starts. Otherwise, the icons swap back to inform the user that this was not a valid swap to make.
* Pink background - when the game starts the backgrund of the game board is pink. When the match is made by the user, the background disappears under the icons that were included in the match. The background does not disappear under the matched that were not directly created by the user, which makes the game more challenging and a little less dependent on luck. When all the background is eliminated the game is won.
* Moves - user has 20 moves to win the game, otherwise they lose. Only valid moves count in this case, so the ones that create at least one match. If the user swaps icons and they swap back, this is not counted as move and it does not decrease the number of moves. The number of moves is visible to the user as soon as the game is started (this is located below the game board, to the left).
* Points - user gets 10 points for each icon in a match that was created as a direct result of the user action. If other matches follow, the points are not counted for these. If an icon makes more than one match, the points are counted for each time it makes a match, which is a bonus for creating a 'clever' match. The points are visible to the user as soon as the game is started (this is located below the game board, to the right).
* Potential valid moves - the game checks if there are any possible valid moves to make (moves that would result in a match). If this is not the case, the game is over. 
* Win - if the user managed to remove the whole pink background in 20 moves or less, it is a win and the game is over.
* Lose - if the user did not manage to remove the whole pink background and ran out of move, it is a lose, and the game is over.
* Game over - regardless the reason the game is over, when it is, initially the game board will fade and a short message will appear together with "Wait fo it..." message. After that, a gif or an image will be loaded with a message about the game result and "Wanna play again?" message. The interim screen is needed to tell the user that something is going to happen and they should wait, otherwise they might miss it. The delay is caused by fetching the resource from an API and drawing it using an external library, so not much can be done to accelerate the process. 
* Game over messages - the messages inform the user of the outcome of the game:
    - win - interim screen: "YAY!"; final screen: "You win!"; gif/image tag: "cute"
    - lose - interim screen: "OH NO!"; final screen: "You lost!"; gif/image tag: "fail"
    - no more valid moves - interim screen: "UPS..."; final screen: "No more possible valid moves"; gif/image tag: "fail"


### Features Left to Implement

* Levels - create more levels to keep the player engaged
* Possible moves information:
    - a counter that informs how many possible moves are there to make at any given time
    - a 'hint' button that when clicked, would show one possible move to make
* Options :
    - difficulty levels - implement different difficulty levels with less moves, more types of tiles, different grid etc.
    - different modes - e.g. instead of number of moves, there is time frame in which the game has to be finished, or a certain amount of points should be achieved
* Extras - implement extra bonuses as a reward for more than 3 icons matched, e.g. getting a move back or being able to detstroy a chosen icon
* Point ranking to be able to compare results either to the past results or to the results of friends


## Technologies Used

* Java Script
* HTML
* CSS
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - used for the responsive design, collapsable navbar, modals and collapsed text
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - an IDE used to write the code
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - used for version control
* [Gifler](http://themadcreator.github.io/gifler/) - a libary used to make gifs work on HTML5 Canvas



## Testing

### Automated testing

* [W3 HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used on the HTML file. No errors were found. 

* [W3 CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to check the CSS file. No errors were found. 

* [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to test the Java Script code. This revealed a number of missed or unncecessary semicolons - which was immediately corrected. The validator also warned to not use 'new' for side effects, refering to creating the Input Handler object in the Game object contructor. However, in this case I decided to keep it this way, as the input handler holds all the click events in its constructor so it feels acceptable to create it as soon as the game is created. 


### Manual testing 

#### Features testing

* When the button 'PLAY' is clicked the game is started, the button changes to 'New game'
* If there are any, the initial matches are removed and the board is replenished - all is animated
* When a cell is clicked, it is highlighted
* When a click happens in a highlighted cell, the highlight disappears
* When a not adjacent cell is clicked, the highlight is removed from the first one and added to the second one
* When two adjacent cells are clicked, the icons swap - this is animated
* When the swap does not make any match, the icons are swapped back - the animation is applied
* When there is a match, the matched icons and the background behind them disappear (provided the background is still there)
* The points are added for each icon in the user-made match
* The "domino" matches, following the user matches, do not make the background disappear, nor give additional points
* Number of moves is decremented every time a match is made by user's move
* User input (on the tiles) is blocked during the resolving phase
* Multiple fast clicking on the board does not break the game and does not have any unexpected or unsolicited effects
* When a moved icon makes more than one match, the points are counted for each match it makes
* When 'New game' is clicked, a new game is started: the icons change, the points and moves are reset, the background color comes back to the whole board. This does not take the user to the starting screen.
* When there are no more possible valid moves to make, the game ends, the interim screen with the correct message ("UPS...") is displayed, after that a gif/image (fail) is loaded with message informing that there are no more valid moves to make
* When the moves counter reaches 0, the game ends, the interim screen with the correct message ("OH NO!") is displayed, after that a gif/image (fail) is loaded with message informing that the player lost
* When the whole background is cleared, the game ends, the interim screen with the correct message ("YAY!") is displayed, after that a gif/image (cute) is loaded with message informing that the player won
* If the background clearance coincides with the move counter reaching zero, the win option is triggered
* When the game ends, the 'PLAY AGAIN' button appears. When clicked, it brings the player to the start screen when they can choose when to start another game. 
* When the application is opened in IE, instead of the game and he instructions, an image of a crying cat and the message is displayed.

##### Known bugs

* When the 'New game' button is clicked quickly and repeatedly, sometimes the icons that are falling come down blinking and/or they fall on top of other icons. After this is resolved, the right icons are on the right places and the game can proceed normally. This has no effect on the logic of the game, but it can be visually confusing and breaks the aesthetics of the game. The bug has to do with the asynchronous code and I tried to block the button for some time after it is first clicked but it does not solve the problem. The click event is not applied on the button whie the game is in the 'reset' state, however this also does not solve it. This does not happen when the button is clicked once or more times but with short time intervals. The bug does not interrupt the game flow and with usual use of the 'New game' button (pressing it once in awhile to reset the game), it will not occure. Therefore, I decided not to investigate it further for the time being, as I exhausted all the ways I could try to fix it, with my current knowledge and skills.
* Some of the gifs are not displayed properly - the image is blinking or the text is broken. This is cause by the library I am using (Gifler) and therefore I cannot do much about it. The majority of the gifs are displayed correctly and the ones that are not, do not prevent user from using the game or learning their outcome.
* Gifs and images are displayed with a delay. This happens the first time a game is finished with a type of outcome, e.g. first time the game is won, there is a delay, the second time not anymore, because the gif or image are cached so this happens quicker. This has to do with the Cats as a service API and/or Gifler library so, again, there is not much to do with it. As the wait time might confuse the user, I implemented an interim screen that shows immediately after the game ended and provides a short message, depending on the result, as well as message asking the user to wait a bit.


#### Browser support

* The application was tested and works properly on: Chrome v77, Chrome v77 on Android, Opera v63, Microsoft Edge v44, Firefox v69
* On IE the game does not work, an empty canvas was shown. Since this browser is no longer recommended for web browsing, even by Microsoft, and it does not support modern JS syntax, I decided not to change my code or look for ways it could work on IE. Instead, I wrote some additional HTML and CSS that will only be displayed on IE (v10 and higher). This includes a cat image and an information for the user that the game doesn't work on IE but it does on any other browser. 


#### Responsive design
* The application was tested using Google Chrome Developer Tools to check how it looks like in case of different width and height by choosing 'Responsive' option and resizing the window. Using Chrom Dev Tools, it was also tested how the website looks on: Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2XL, iPhone 5/6/7/8/X, iPad and iPad Pro. In all these views the website is responsive and shows content properly.
* The application was also tested on the following devices: Samsung Galaxy A3, Asus laptop 15", Dell laptop 13.3", a 24" monitor, Kindle Fire tablet. On all of this devices the website is responsive and shows content properly. 
* On mobile phones, that are shorter, the 'How to play' button is moved to the top and the title is moved to the left and is no longer cenetered.
* On longer mobile phones, the button is under the canvas and the game is vertically centered, similarly on smaller tablets (like Kindle Fire).
* On bigger tablets, like iPad, the button is no longer visible, instead the instructions are displayed below the game area, similarly on other taller screens.
* On standard desktops the instructions are displayed to the left of the game area. 

#### Potential users review

I asked a couple of friends to play the game and give me their feedback.

* most of the people expected that the background will be destroyed when the 'domino' matches are removed, as this is what happens in the match-3 games that they know. I felt that this would make the too easy for the player with the current game board (as this is just a simple rectangle). As this information was already included in the instructions, I decided to highlight this text, to make it stand-out so that a user will read it, and in result will know what to expect before starting the game.
* I have also received some questions on what happens if there are no more moves. Similarly, to the above, this is described in the instructions, so I decided to highlight this part as well.

The people who tested used:
* Browsers: Chrome for Android, Chrome on Windows, Safari
* Devices: iPhone7, Android phone, PC

They did not report any problem with the display of the appliction and its responsiveness.
