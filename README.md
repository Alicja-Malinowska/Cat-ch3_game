# [CAT-CH3](https://alicja-malinowska.github.io/Cat-ch3_game/) - A match-3 game full of kitties!


This is a match-3 style game written using HTML Canvas and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to match enough tiles to clear the pink background. The background under each tile is cleared when a tile is matched with at least 2 other tiles of the same kind. The tiles then disappear, background behind them gets cleared, tiles above them fall down and new tiles are added from the top to fill all rows and columns. The match attempt is made by clicking one tile and then another(adjacent) for them to swap places, if in result of that there is at least one match (a row of at least 3 tiles with the same symbol), the matching tiles are destroyed. Each destroyed tile is worth 10 points. There is a limited number of moves in which a player has to clear the board. The game is over when the board is clear (win), when a player runs out of moves or if there are no valid moves to make (it is impossible to make a match by swapping any tiles on the board) (lose).

#### Site owner's goal:

## UX

The target audience for this application are mobile phone users. The game is simple so it is expected to be played on a mobile device when a user wants quick entertainment to which does not have to commit a lot of time. For example, to play on a bus, during lunch break etc. For this reason, the size of the game is designed to fit in a mobile device screen and take up the majority of it. However, the game can be played on any device. 

The cat theme is there to make the game more funny and it is mostly targeted at the people who like cats and/or are frequent users of websites with memes etc, which are full of funny cats. 

The name of the game was designed to be a word play, as the type of the game is match-3, but the theme is cats, which you should 'catch' on the board to win. 

This is a single page application with a simple design, so that the game window is the most important part of the website. The user can immediately start playing the game or they may choose to read the intructions first. The instructions are available at any stage of the game. It is also easy and straight-forward to restart the game or start a new one after finishing.
